# OBDII-java

Sample data and tools that I used to generate CSV files:

The mdf2csv.exe enables quick conversion of the raw MDF4 data into a simple CSV format that you can load in text editors, Excel and other tools.

For the raw data, I used the CSV file generated from the MF4 file in the Data & DBC samples.

In the interest of time and getting the project working, I copied and pasted and reformatted the DBC file into a CSV. I copied the formulas for calculating the values from Wikipedia. 

Later versions could include the ability to upload DBC files from various sources.
